### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Camilla. 

I love engineering, artificial intelligence, computer science and mathematics: I am particularry interested in implementing technology to solve problems and improve efficiency.

I have a strong attitude toward inventing, creating and building; these are some of my projects:
- *MyWallet*: a platform of algorithmic trading (Statistical model in **R**, frontend in **ReactJS**)
- *Mosuniq*: a machine to create mosaics (Image processing in **Python** to create a mosaic from an image, control of motion with **C++**)
- *XEV Roboter*: a robot arm that sort balls by color (Color recognition in **Python** with OpenCV, control of robot with **C++**)

I am currently working on:
- *IoT_Sensor*: a fitband that interact with a biomedical sensor to detect heart frequency and oxigen (**C/C++**)
- *ResearchTED*: an university project of an app to support research funds through watching TED talks (backend in **Python**, frontend in **Flutter**, **MongoDB**, **AWS**)
- some small projects of computer vision with **Python and OpenCV**

I pursued a student-athlete career for more than 15 years: this taught me to push myself to the limit in every aspect of file and I always try to improve myself and my skills. If you wanto other information about me read my website [Website link](https://camillamazzoleni.com/)
