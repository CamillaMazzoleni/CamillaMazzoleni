Hi, I'm Camilla 👋
I'm passionate about engineering, artificial intelligence, and applied mathematics. I love using technology to solve real-world problems, especially where software meets hardware.

I’m particularly drawn to building full-stack systems - from control logic and embedded devices to deep learning pipelines and intuitive user interfaces.

🚀 Selected Projects
- Localizr:
After struggling to find my way around ETH, I built a GPS-free indoor localization system using image-based 3D reconstruction. It now supports ETH’s navigation infrastructure and is adaptable to warehouses or large vessels.
- ShapeFlex (under submission):
A 3D generation pipeline akin to DALL·E — but for shapes. We use diffusion models to deform primitive representations into complex 3D objects.
- ARPalace:
A memory training tool using augmented reality. Built in 48h at the AIxGoogle Hackathon, won the competition, and received an acquisition offer from Braynr.ai.
- Mosuniq:
A machine that builds physical mosaics from any image, entirely designed and built at 14. I developed a clustering algorithm to reduce color palettes, built a full motion-control system in C++, and soldered the electronics myself.
- RehubAI:
A startup idea to support physical rehabilitation using machine learning and pose estimation, born from my personal journey as a professional skier turned engineer.


Other projects include:

- MyWallet: A React + R platform for algorithmic trading
- XEV Roboter: A robot that sorts colored balls using OpenCV and C++
- IoT_Sensor: A wearable that reads heart rate and oxygen saturation via biomedical sensors


🏔 From Ski Slopes to Labs
Before ETH, I was a student-athlete for over 15 years, competing at a high level in alpine skiing. That journey shaped my mindset: disciplined, resilient, and relentless.
