### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Camilla.

I love engineering, artificial intelligence, computer science and mathematics: I am particularry interested in implementing technology to solve problems and improve efficiency.

I have a strong attitude toward inventing, creating and building; this are some of my projects:
- MyWallet: a platform of algorithmic trading (Statistical model in *R*, frontend in *ReactJS*)
- Mosuniq: a machine to create mosaics (Image processing in Python to create a mosaic from an image, control of motion with C++)
- XEV Roboter: a robot arm that sort balls by color (Color recognition in Python with OpenCV, control of robot with C++)

I am currently working on:
- MAXM8616: a biomedical sensor to detect heart frequency and oxigen (C/C++)
- some small projects of computer vision with Python and OpenCV

I pursued a student-athlete career for more than 15 years: this taught me to push mysself to the limit in every aspect of file and I always try to improve myself and my skills.
